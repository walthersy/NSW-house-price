# Project Summary 
In this project, we have chosen to analyse the property prices in NSW, Australia. 

Given the real estate market activity in NSW, we were curious to see how the relationship between housing data, demographics, 
and certain economic factors interact with one another. 
Also, we were curious whether we could predict housing data in each postcode with these variables.

We explored questions such as:
- [x] Where should one buy a home?
- [x] Can we predict prices based on socioeconomic data such as income levels, household size, or interest rates?
- [x] Can we predict which postcodes will grow faster than average?

# Notebook Structure

* **Main Notebook** - This is where the codes for the main part of the analysis and predictive modelling are
* **Data Preparation Pt1 (NSW Housing data)** - This notebook is where we cleaned all the files for the NSW Housing data
* **Data Preparation Pt2 (Feature data)** - This notebook is where we cleaned all the features that we used
* **Variable Analysis** - This is where we deep-dive into the analysis of all the variables
